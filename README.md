# C# DivideByZeroException Example

This repository demonstrates a simple example of a DivideByZeroException in C#.  The `bug.cs` file contains code with the error, and `bugSolution.cs` provides a solution to prevent the exception.

The problem occurs when an integer division is attempted with a zero divisor.  This is a common error that can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior. The solution demonstrates the use of input validation and conditional logic to handle potential zero-division scenarios gracefully.
